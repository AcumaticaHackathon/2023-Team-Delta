## Project: Advance File Management for Acumatica ERP
#### Organize and make better sense of your stored files.  With Advanced File Management, Acumatica will analyze file attachment text, categorize the file and store the text into the Global Search.  This supports any files with text contained within them.

#### Category Rules

Here you can configure keywords and the category you wish to associate those keywords too.  When attaching files containing text, these keywords will be used to automatically select a category.   

<b>Category ID:</b> Select the category from a list of categories configured under Category Configuration 
<b>Word Delimiter ID:</b> Enter a Word Delimiter (, - etc) to separate different words required to be found to categorize based on these keywords. 
<b>Threshold Delimiter ID:</b> Add Threshold Delimiter and use that delimiter followed by a number to categorize based on a keyword  that occurs that number of times.
